Project N-Dimensions and its author: florencio Valladlid Rodriguez

 It leaves you free and full access to the first video game or 3D demo, "un mundo nuevo" as a powerful example of an app for the web,  that only needs the web browser of any device, of code free made  with the 3d engine webgl "verge3d"  in javascript, html5 and css3, and the current state of development using only blender, gimp and audacity and notepad ++, has no  nothing to envy to genres of video games as shooters, puzzle, simulation, adventures ... etc of other engines that are generated as native app and require for its access to specific high-end equipment.

Its simplicity and fast implementation, clearly differentiates it for be ideal to start in 3d developments, learning and this development, just need to support it in its crowdfounding  to get beyond it to be a multiplayer online game and without limits more than the hardware and that we are imposed by web browsers that luckily is improving day by day.  


Forecasts


If you have support for crowfounding, you could guarantee the video tutorials, with a weekly exit, organize the existing modules, starting with an access to the scene, use your own mesh for the character and, little by little, in the rest of the tutorials you will interact with the scene and managing the gamepad, the keyboard and touch screen touch, collect objects, hit, shoot, take damage, save the state game, etc.etc A content that seeing the operational demo available online both on the web and Google Play, is already very complete for beginners. And the goal is to expand it with more effects thanks to particle systems, make more levels and improve current levels with all the current deficiencies that do not impede the functionality that all video game developers want. Remember to support the crowdfounding so that together we can achieve it.

For devolop

Once downloaded the engine verge3d,


https://www.soft8soft.com/get-verge3d/

 leave it in any unzipped folder, open blender add it in scripts the path to dir ../verge3d and check in the list of addons. Then in 3d view of the blender you will have the button to the manager that opens a URL in your browser to manage any project.
http: // localhost: 8668 /

  That of a new world you leave in the dir applications as the rest of the app of existing examples there. It will appear ej
http: // localhost: 8668 / applications / atlantida_tuto01_build / index.html
and contine the binaries to the meshes and their images. The edition is a matter of each one that generates its own and makes available as I describe in the video tutorials.
